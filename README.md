# EtsyX

EtsyX is a Bootstrap and Etsy Web toolkit prototype optimized for desktop and mobile.

What to check out (order is important):

You can click the EtsyX logo to reset and return to the original home page

1. EtsyX Home page: http://thecatspajamas.morganedgerton.com/EtsyX/
  - Click anywhere you are prompted to **Apply to be an astronaut**
  * Other details of EtsyX Home are not built out (Astronaut profiles, Blog, etc.)
2. Apply to be an astronaut: http://thecatspajamas.morganedgerton.com/EtsyX/apply-1.html
  * You do not need to enter information in the fields to continue. 
  - Click through each page of the application process. You will land on the Thank You Status page.
  - Thank you Status page: When you click **Back to EtsyX home** you will land on the *applied version* of EtsyX Home. The applied version reflects a post-application state with links available to *Check application status*. http://thecatspajamas.morganedgerton.com/EtsyX/home-applied.html
  * Error messaging per field could not be added in this version of the prototype (verification js was not available to me)
3. EtsyXAcademy - a portal accessible to those who have been selected for the flight and their guides: 
  - Enter this url to access portal: http://thecatspajamas.morganedgerton.com/EtsyX/academy-home.html
  - Only the *Conversations* area of Academy is built out. Navigate there by clicking **Conversations** or the icon in the nav bar or **See more** in the Conversations snapshot
 
 Sorry the project file organization is really messy!

 Thank you for taking a look!
